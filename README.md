# Human-Pose-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning
 Problem Statement 
 
 Human pose estimation focuses on identifying and tracking key body joints—such as shoulders, elbows, and knees—in images and videos. Despite progress in computer vision, achieving real-time performance, managing occlusions, and ensuring accuracy across various poses, lighting conditions, and body types remains challenging. Conventional approaches often lack computational efficiency or falter in dynamic environments. Solving these challenges is crucial, as accurate pose estimation underpins critical applications in healthcare (like physical therapy), sports analytics, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Overcoming these limitations paves the way for scalable, real-world solutions in motion analysis and behavioral understanding.
